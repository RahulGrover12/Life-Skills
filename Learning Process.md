## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
In this video, an interesting idea is how the brain can switch between "focused" (active) and "diffused" (relaxed) modes of thinking to improve learning.
And there are some interesting topics mentioned in the video that one should focus on.
#### Brain's Dual Modes:
- **Focus Mode:** Used for focused attention and problem-solving.
- **Diffuse Mode:** Essential for creative thinking and developing new insights.

#### Overcoming Obstacles:
- **Procrastination:** The Pomodoro Technique can help manage procrastination by breaking tasks into focused work intervals one can also start their work and after 2-5 minutes they get habituated to work by making a motto to complete the task. 
- **Learning Disabilities:** Even with challenges like poor working memory or slow thinking, effective learning strategies can be employed. 

#### Effective Learning Techniques:
- **Active Recall:** Testing oneself regularly to improve memory.
- **Spaced Repetition:** Reviewing concepts at intervals to effectively remember concepts.
- **Mindful Practice:** Improving quality over quantity learning.

#### The Role of Mindset:
- **Growth Mindset:** Believing in improving through effort and learning.
- **Embracing Challenges:** Viewing challenges as opportunities for growth.


## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

- **Active Mode:** A focused and concentrated way of thinking used for solving specific problems or learning details of a concept.
