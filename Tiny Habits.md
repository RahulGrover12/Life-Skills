### 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
In the video, the most interesting idea for me is BJ Fogg’s concept of "Tiny Habits". 
He emphasizes that instead of trying to make big changes, focusing on small, manageable habits is more effective. 
By starting small, you can create a chain of positive behaviors that gradually lead to bigger changes over time. 
This approach makes the process feel less overwhelming and more sustainable.

### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
*B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.*
- M (Motivation): One need some level of motivation to perform the behavior.
- A (Ability): The behavior must be easy enough to do. It should not be too difficult or complicated.
- P (Prompt): There must be a reminder to perform the behavior.

### 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
Celebrating each successful completion of a habit is crucial because celebration reinforces the behavior. 
When you celebrate, our brain recognizes it as a positive experience, which strengthens the habit loop and makes it more likely to continue. 
As BJ Fogg says, whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.

### 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
In the video, the most interesting idea was the power of small improvements. 
James Clear emphasizes that getting just 1% better every day can lead to massive improvement over time. 
He shared how tiny habits compound, and how focusing on consistent, incremental progress is more effective than aiming for dramatic changes. 
This concept encourages sustainable growth and motivates us to keep going, even when results are not immediately appear.

### 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The book emphasizes that identity is key to forming lasting habits. 
Instead of focusing solely on what you want to achieve, you should focus on who you want to become.
Building habits based on our identity reinforces those behaviors and makes them more sustainable.

### 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
To make habits easier, one should reduce friction by designing one's environment to support the behavior. 
This can include things like making a task more convenient, so it requires less effort to start.
For instance, preparing your next day routine at today night itself to make all the tasks in a proper manner.

### 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
To make a habit harder, you should increase friction by adding obstacles or barriers. 
For example, you can make a negative habit less accessible like keeping phone aside and keeping it in silent mode.

### 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
One habit I’d like to do more of is solving two leetcode problem daily. To make it easier:
- Planning time to solve in my daily routine.
- Choosing which problems to solve in the before day itself.
- Avoiding distractions during the working time.
- Rewarding myself when I solve problem with least complexity.

### 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
One habit I’d like to reduce is mindless social media scrolling. To make it harder:
- Remove social media apps from my home screen or turn off notifications.
- Set a timer for using social media.
- Replace it with spending time with my family.
