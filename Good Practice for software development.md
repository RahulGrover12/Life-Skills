### 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

- The idea of immediately documenting and sharing requirements for feedback and future reference is a very practical step, ensuring clarity and reducing misunderstandings over time.

- Not letting calls go unanswered and instead calling back within a set time frame (5-10 minutes) is a useful communication tactic.

- While asking clear questions, using screencasts, diagrams, or tools like Loom and Github gists to explain technical issues is the best way to reduce ambiguity and speed up clearing the doubts.

- To write down all questions and ask our team members in one message instead of irritating them with multiple messages. 


### 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I think I should be improved on managing time and focus during work. 
I need to work on managing distractions, particularly from social media, which are sometimes reducing my focus and productivity. 
Ensuring that I stay fully involved in my work for focused periods to improve my productivity.

*Ideas for Progress:*

- I could start keeping away my mobile for some focused periods to avoid distractions.
- Setting strict boundaries for work hours and break times to ensure that I am fully focused when I need to be, and also give myself the freedom to relax during breaks.
- I start using a time-tracking app to evaluate how my time is spent throughout the day, helping me identify areas where I can improve focus or reallocate time.
- Noting down what I done during my day to make sure for myself whether I am working towards my goal.
